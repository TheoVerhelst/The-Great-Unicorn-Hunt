## Setup
Create a virtual environment (with virtualenv, or let PyCharm handle it), then
run the following in a terminal with the virtual env activated:

```
pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

You can now test that your libraries work by running

```
python3 run_me.py
```
It should display a vector of numbers.
